# Work Day Scheduler

## About the app
This web application is a simple way to schedule your work day! 
It provides a timeblock for each hour from 9am to 5pm where you can jot down
and save important meetings and reminders. This application's timeblocks also 
change color depending on the time so you can visually see what's already 
passed(grey), what is currently going on this hour(red), and what is coming up(green).
